# MAUI Beginner Task: Simple Photo Gallery

## Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly task designed for those new to **.NET MAUI**. It involves creating a simple photo gallery application with 8 pictures and navigation buttons. The gallery allows users to navigate through the images using **"Up"** and **"Down"** buttons.

## Features

- **Dynamic and Static UI Creation**: Demonstrates two ways of creating UI:
  - **Dynamic in Code**: The navigation of pictures is designed from the first picture to the last.
  - **Static in XAML**: The navigation of images is designed in a circular way.
- **Simple Navigation**: Use the **"Up"** and **"Down"** buttons to navigate through the gallery of images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The navigation buttons are enabled or disabled based on the current image index to provide a smooth user experience.
- **Icon Fonts for Navigation**: The application uses icon fonts for the `Text` property of the **"Up"** and **"Down"** buttons, displaying arrow symbols for a clear and visually appealing navigation interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the gallery looks good on different screen sizes.
